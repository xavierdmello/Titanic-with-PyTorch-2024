This model can predict titanic survivors with ~80% accuracy based on features such as age, social class, and ticket price.

Since I'm learning PyTorch right now, I thought it would be a fun challenge to build a neural network! However, as a disclaimer for other beginners, decision trees are usually better for a simple problem like this.
